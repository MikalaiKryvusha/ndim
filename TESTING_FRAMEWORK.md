# TESTING_FRAMEWORK — how the agent tests what it creates

Raw generated content — code, a document, an analysis, anything — **must not be trusted**. It may *look*
logical and working and still be broken, or fail the owner's actual requirements (the idea, the plan, the
vision). An early defect that rides silently to production is the most expensive kind — it destroys
projects from the inside. Testing is a distinct, first-class part of ALL work, not a formality after it.
This document is the agent's testing canon; it applies to **every artifact in every sphere** — a function,
a dataset, a legal clause, a bridge design, a thought (what "verify" means in your sphere is defined by
the project's sphere library: its *Verification by observation* and *Minimum evidence set* sections).

## The seven principles of testing (the canon)

1. **Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence.** A green suite never proves the product
   has no bugs — bugs ALWAYS exist; testing lowers the risk, never to zero.
2. **Exhaustive testing is impossible.** You cannot check every input/state combination — prioritize by
   risk and value instead of pretending completeness.
3. **Early testing saves the budget.** Verify at the requirements/plan stage; the later a defect is
   found, the more it costs (the waterfall skyscraper on an untested foundation).
4. **Defects cluster.** Most bugs live in a few narrow modules — where one was found, hunt for more
   (the fable-method twin check is this principle mechanized).
5. **The pesticide paradox.** The same tests stop finding new bugs — vary the tests, angles, and data.
6. **Testing is context-dependent.** Methods are chosen per project and sphere — a payment system, a
   research paper, and a landing page are not tested alike.
7. **The absence-of-errors fallacy.** A defect-free product that does not solve the user's task is
   worthless — always test against the OWNER'S requirements (`GOAL.md`, the idea, the plan), not only
   against the code's own consistency.

## Test-status markers — the trust contract

Every non-trivial artifact the agent generates carries an explicit, grep-friendly test status in its
comment / accompanying note. The marker strings are canonical English (like the `DONE` tag), regardless
of the project language:

- **`[NOT-TESTED]`** — freshly generated, raw. **Do not trust it.** The LLM "thought" it was right;
  that is not evidence.
- **`[TESTED: <date> · <how it was verified / what was observed>]`** — verified by observation, with
  the evidence named (a run, a render, a recomputation, a check against the source).

**The rules:**

1. **Creating raw content** (a non-trivial block/method/module/section) → write `[NOT-TESTED]` into its
   comment at birth. Commenting is already mandatory (`AGENT_GUIDE.md`); the marker is part of the
   initial comment.
2. **Meeting `[NOT-TESTED]`** (yours or inherited) → do not build on it blindly: plan its verification,
   verify **by observation** (fable-method Step 5: it ran, it rendered, it counted — never inferred from
   reading), then flip the marker to `[TESTED: …]` with the evidence named.
3. **Meeting `[TESTED: …]`** → you may trust it and need not re-test — but keep a grain of doubt
   (principle 1: bugs always exist). If evidence contradicts the marker, the marker is wrong: investigate.
4. **Testing found a defect** → file it (`/report-bug`, method: `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`), fix, re-test,
   and only then mark `[TESTED]`.
5. **A false `[TESTED]`** — the marker present with no verification actually performed — is a fraud;
   `/fable-judge` hunts it like any false completion claim. Never flip a marker without the observation.
6. **Carrier by artifact type:** code → the block/method comment; a document → the section's note; any
   other sphere → the nearest commentable carrier the sphere convention offers.

Markers are the persistent memory of verification: fable-method's Step 5 verifies *in the moment*; the
marker preserves that fact **across sessions**, for future agents and posterity — who else will know the
foundation was load-tested?

## The work produces its own means of checking

"Raw deserves no trust" binds the PRODUCER, not only the checker: building something includes
building what checks it — a test suite, a check-list, test cases, a fixture, a guard. They are
planned WITH the work and land in the SAME step, never "later": verification postponed to a later
step is verification that never happens, and verification that lives only in a session's scratchpad
dies with the session. This is principle 3 (early testing) applied to production rather than to
inspection, and it is why the harness section below exists — the harness is what makes the checking
repeatable once it exists.

Two operational consequences, one on each side of the work:

- **New behaviour is born with the check that watches it** — and the check is proven on the broken
  version before its green is trusted (gate 5 below; `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` → Guards).
- **A closed defect is born with the guard for its CLASS** — that rule already lives in
  `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` ("a fix without a guard is a fix on credit") and is not restated here.

The triviality gate applies: a trivial change verified by its one obvious check needs no ceremony
beyond the usual comment and marker. What is never legal is finishing non-trivial work with nothing
that can re-check it.

## Green tests ≠ working — the observation gates

A green suite is one observation, not the verdict (principle 1): whole classes of defects are invisible
to every test and obvious to one minute of looking. Before "done" on anything that runs, renders, or
ships, walk the gates that apply:

1. **Live smoke with your eyes on the log.** Run the real process (not only the tests) and read its
   first working cycle in the log — startup, the key operation, no silent error spam.
2. **Self-sufficiency of the shipped artifact.** The image/bundle/package must start in isolation (a
   fresh container/directory) — a build that only works inside your working tree is not shipped.
3. **Domain invariants, before/after.** Before the work, write down the numbers that must not change
   (counts, sums, sizes); after, compare. Comparing two numbers is the one check any session performs
   perfectly — and its signal is among the highest there is.
4. **Countable quality proxies.** Where quality is visual or subjective, find what can be counted
   (animations per screen, panel-opacity checks, bundle growth): a zero on the counter is a stop-defect.
   A proxy never replaces the owner's eye — it catches the zeros *before* the owner has to.
5. **A check that has never failed proves nothing.** Every new guard/check is verified on a broken
   version first (see `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` → Guards); goldens for refactors are byte-exact —
   an empty diff is proof, "the numbers look the same" is not.

## The taste class — when the observer must be human

A subjectively-perceptual acceptance criterion (a perception adjective: beautiful, natural,
pleasant, "feels right") is still verified by observation — but the OBSERVER is the human, by
necessity, not the agent. The agent's role is to PREPARE the observation: produce a mock-up on the
project's own material and hand over an artifact to perceive (`AGENT_GUIDE.md` → "The taste
class"; the homework doc with its two standing fields). The agent's own "sounds good to me" is not
a verification and never flips a marker; the owner's recorded verdict is.

## How this composes with the rest of KAIF

- **`REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md`** — shapes what is REQUIRED before anything is made; this framework
  verifies what was MADE against it. Principle 3 (early testing) is executed at the requirements
  stage by that canon; bugs are what is born where the two meet (`BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`).
- **fable-method** — Step 5 (verify by observation) is HOW a single check is performed; this framework
  says WHAT must carry a status and how trust propagates. The triviality gate still applies: a trivial
  change verified by its one obvious check needs no ceremony beyond its normal comment.
- **`/fable-judge`** — treats test-status markers as claims: a `[TESTED]` it cannot reproduce is REFUTED.
- **`BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`** — where testing's findings go (one doc per defect; 3 attempts → research).
- **Spheres** (`.kaif/spheres/`) — define the sphere's evidence, verification-by-observation meaning, and
  fraud table; principle 6 lives there.
- **The harness** — invest in tooling that makes verification observable and deterministic
  (`AGENT_GUIDE.md` → Test harness); eyeballing is not testing.
