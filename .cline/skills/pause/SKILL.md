# /pause — end the work session

The human is pausing. Run the wrap-up routine **in order**. Narrate each step briefly in the chat.
Don't skip steps. If a step fails — stop, tell the human, don't continue blindly.

## Step 1. Record status & plans in STATUS.md

Update `STATUS.md`:
- **What was done this session** — concrete, tied to bugs/features and files.
- **Current position** — what works, what's in progress, where we are.
- **Plans for next session** — a clear "where to continue" checklist (commands, files, what to verify
  first). Remember: the next agent session starts with empty context — write so it can jump straight in.
- Convert relative dates to absolute (find today's date from context / `date`).

Reconcile with the active bug docs in `bugs/` and reflect their status.

## Step 2. Refresh README

Bring `README.md` in line with reality: phase status, working features, instructions. If the README is
bilingual, keep both languages in sync. Don't invent — reflect only what is actually done and verified.

## Step 3. (Re)build / regenerate artifacts

`<Run the project build and any artifact regeneration (e.g. a rendered README.pdf). For this framework's
own project: `node tools/build-framework.mjs` regenerates KAIF.md, and `node tools/readme-pdf.mjs`
regenerates README.pdf.>` If a build fails, stop and show the errors — don't commit broken state.

## Step 4. Commit and push

`<Use your commit tool/flow. If you have one (e.g. tools/commit.mjs that bumps build, adds, commits,
pushes), run it. Otherwise: git add -A && git commit -m "..." && git push.>`

Message style (from `AGENT_GUIDE.md`): `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `refactor:` / `ci:` + one line.
End the message with:
```
Co-Authored-By: <YOUR AGENT/MODEL> <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Step 5. Report

Briefly report to the human: what was recorded, what was built, the commit hash, what was pushed, and
one line — the main plan for next session. That's the pause.

## Notes

- If a push is rejected (non-fast-forward) — `git pull --rebase`, retry the push, then tell the human
  about the divergence.
- Generated artifacts that are gitignored (e.g. README.pdf, build outputs) won't be committed — that's fine.
