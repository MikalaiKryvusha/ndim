# KAIF Reference — the explanatory note

This document is the COMPLETE technical reference of Krinik AI Framework (KAIF): every module
of the framework is named, defined and located here, and the internal terminology is established
here. It is written for two readers at once: the human who wants to understand what is deployed in
their project, and the AI agent that must answer such questions precisely (`/help-kaif` reads this
document and cites its sections). Statements of obligation use "shall"/"never"; statements of
permission use "may". Section numbers are stable addresses: cite them as "Reference §N.M".

The one-glance essence: KAIF externalizes an AI agent's working memory and discipline into the
repository itself — documents, directories and skills that any fresh session reads to resume with
full context. Everything mechanizable is done by machinery; the agent's cognitive work is reserved
for understanding the project and making judgment calls.

## 1. Terms and definitions

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Payload** | The set of canonical templates deployed into a target project. Single source: the origin repository's `framework/` directory. |
| **Wrapper** | The framework applied to a concrete project: the deployed documents, directories and skills, plus the project's own knowledge base. |
| **Core (thin)** | `KAIF.md` — the ~150-line entry point: a three-step bootstrap that fetches the installer machinery. Transient in the target project. |
| **Machinery** | `KAIF-CORE.mjs`, deployed as `.kaif/kaif-core.mjs` — the installer/updater executable that performs every mechanizable step. |
| **Bundle** | `KAIF-CORE-BUNDLE.md` — every deployable file as `FILE:` blocks plus one meta block (§8.2). |
| **Module** | A logical section of a template — the atom of diffing and replacement (§9). Everything from one heading line to the next; the text before the first heading is the `<preamble>` module. |
| **Signature anchor** | A module's address: its full unique heading line. Nothing is added to documents; line numbers are derived, recomputed on every build. |
| **Module class** | `static` — upstream-owned, mechanically replaceable · `adaptive` — carries project values, replaced with value transfer · `owner` — the owner's content, never in the machinery's scope. |
| **Module map** | The generated inventory of all modules with anchors, classes and hashes: `kaif-module-map.json` (§9.1). |
| **Template sha / disk sha** | Two snapshot provenances: what THIS framework version deploys (post-fill, EOL-normalized) vs. what lies on disk. Only a template-sha match authorizes mechanical replacement. |
| **Adoption (kept)** | Taking an existing file as found instead of writing the template. An adopted path's snapshot is owner content and never authorizes replacement. |
| **Synthetic baseline** | A template snapshot reconstructed from the OLD version's own release artifact, used when a deployment carries no snapshots (§10.4). |
| **Marker** | `.kaif/kaif.json` — the deployment record (§12.1). |
| **Deploy manifest** | `.kaif/deploy-manifest.json` — the deployment's snapshot ledger (§12.2). |
| **Receipt** | `.kaif/last-update.json` — the permanent proof of the last update (§12.3). |
| **Owner** | The human whose vision the project serves. The owner's word outranks every document. |
| **Canon artifact** | An owner document whose wording IS the content (rules, lore, brand texts). AI text enters it only marked (§13.3). |
| **Contour** | A top-level logical module of the system or of the methodology itself: a complete closed stack of context on one direction — boundaries · governance · execution layer · quality control (`AGENT_GUIDE.md` → Contours). |

## 2. Design principles

1. **Externalized memory.** State lives in files, not in a chat: a session may die at any moment
   and the next one shall resume from the repository alone.
2. **Bounded autonomy.** The agent decides what is cheap to revert; vision-level decisions belong
   to the owner and travel through interviews.
3. **Mechanize, then trust.** Whatever can be checked by code is checked by code; conventions are
   backed by guards, and a guard is proven able to fire before it is trusted.
4. **Respectful by construction.** The machinery never overwrites what it cannot prove it
   deployed; the owner's content is byte-inviolable across every operation.
5. **One source, many surfaces.** Every template lives once in the payload; deployed copies and
   per-system mirrors are derived mechanically.

## 3. The two layers of the origin repository

The origin repository is fractal: it IS the framework and is WRAPPED by it. Layer one — the
payload (`framework/`), generated into the distribution artifacts. Layer two — the origin's own
wrapper (root documents, `.claude/skills/`, knowledge directories) — the framework applied to the
framework. Deployment into user projects flows ONLY from the distribution artifacts, never from
the origin's wrapper.

## 4. Distribution artifacts

Each release attaches five artifacts (their roles are machine-readable in `kaif-manifest.json`):

| Artifact | Role |
|---|---|
| `KAIF.md` | The thin entry point; transient in the target project. |
| `KAIF-CORE.mjs` | The machinery; survives as `.kaif/kaif-core.mjs` (except on anonymous deployments, §11.3). |
| `KAIF-CORE-BUNDLE.md` | The COMPLETE deployable set: documents, skills, spheres, optional tool modules, the optional refresh-hooks module, language packs. |
| `kaif-manifest.json` | Version, codename, sha256 pins of the fetched pair, asset roles. |
| `KAIF-FULL.md` | The offline fallback core — a SUBSET (no language packs/spheres/references); not an authoritative diff baseline (only a last-resort candidate for a synthetic one, §10.4). |

## 5. The document system

Fourteen key documents ship with a deployment (thirteen project documents plus this reference):

| Document | Purpose | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `AGENT_GUIDE.md` | The canon: rules, map, commands, conventions. | Machinery deploys; agent adapts. |
| `PHILOSOPHY.md` | How the agent thinks: simplicity (KISS + Occam) and the wider principle set. | Deployed verbatim. |
| `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` | How defects are fixed: intent gate, 3-attempt rule, twin check, class-not-instance, guards. | Deployed verbatim. |
| `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` | Nothing raw is trusted: the `[NOT-TESTED]`/`[TESTED: …]` contract, observation gates. | Deployed verbatim. |
| `REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md` | How requirements are written and checked: goal vector + acceptance criteria first, the ten quality criteria, EARS, fit criterion, the stop-word dictionary as a lintable guard (2.2, epic N). | Deployed verbatim. |
| `GOAL.md` | The owner's vision. | **The owner.** |
| `MASTER_PLAN.md` | The phased road from the current state to the GOAL. | Agent derives (`/revision`). |
| `STATUS.md` | The living SUMMARY of now and the handover between sessions (soft target ~200 lines — the first of the re-read core's size budgets that `check` warns above, all nine since 2.5; since 2.7 the budget counts the project's OWN lines and the warning names the chronicle as the address; closed work moves to the chronicle — the bonsai trim, and `check --gate-budgets` is the door the closing ritual runs after it). | Agent, after every task. |
| `PROJECT_HISTORY.md` | The append-only chronicle: closed sessions/phases/releases, newest first; NOT in `/resume`'s canon set — archaeology on demand (2.1, epic H). | Agent, at `/end-chat-soft`'s trim. |
| `EXPERIENCE.md` | The grep-friendly journal of lessons with trigger tags. | Agent (`/experience`). |
| `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md` | The external map: directories, files. | Agent maintains. |
| `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_INTERNAL_MAP.md` | The internal map: abstractions and interactions. | Agent maintains. |
| `KAIF_FRAMEWORK.md` | "KAIF, deployed here": the deployment record page. | Agent, after injection. |
| `KAIF_REFERENCE.md` (this document, at `.kaif/`) | The complete framework reference. | Deployed verbatim. |

One OPTIONAL canon document joins the fourteen only when it is earned: **`AUTHOR_STYLOMETRY.md`** in
the project root — the owner's voice portrait (`/owner-voice`), written by the agent from the owner's
own texts and accepted by the owner. It ships as a SKELETON (`.kaif/_owner-voice-template.md`), never
as a filled file or a stub: a deployment without a portrait is complete and `check` stays green. Its
history is kept INSIDE the file, append-only (§9 of the skeleton), and its §8 is a TABLE of machine
heuristics (pattern · class · hint · exception) that the shipped linter `kaif-voice-lint` reads as the
machine half of the independent check after a text is written BY the portrait (2.7, epic VC: written by
the portrait → checked independently by it → fixed → only then written and brought to the owner). Two
bundle-only skeletons of the
same family serve the testing canon: `.kaif/_testcases-template.md` (2.3 — the case set per feature,
`TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` → the activities chain) and `.kaif/_testrun-report-template.md` (2.7, epic TR —
the seven-field report an EXECUTED run leaves at `<testdocs>/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>_<work>.md`;
`TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` → "An executed run produces its report"). One more
bundle-only page of the same family (2.6, epic IC; origin issues #19 #38 #47 #51): **`.kaif/INTERACTIVE_CONTOUR_SPEC.md`**
— the one-page executable CONTRACT of the owner-facing interactive contour (the two legal option forms,
the pre-flight that refuses a page without radio buttons with exit 3, the three records and the fact of
showing, outcomes and exit codes, the call, the faces and flags of the shipped generator under
`.kaif/tools/contour/`). The form check is a door of its own — `review.mjs <doc> --check`: parse,
pre-flight and render self-check with no server, no sound and no call (2.7, epic QL, origin issue #56) —
and that door has a SECOND axis, the ARCHAEOLOGY of every live question (2.7, epic AQ, origin issue #70:
13 questions brought to one owner that his own prior answers had already settled, one of them 44 days
after his answer). A question to the owner is a CLAIM that the matter is not settled, so a live question
of a document dated on or after `2026-09-18` opens only with the attestation of the search that was run —
`<!-- archaeology: grep -rniE "<the heading's words>" interviews/ GOAL.md MASTER_PLAN.md plans/ → N hits ·
read: <files|none> · prior: <none | "<the prior answer>" + address> -->` between the heading and the first
option; without it the door exits 3 and PRINTS that ready command, `N > 0` with `prior: none` is refused
too, `N = 0` is honest, and documents dated before that day are never judged (`--check` says which of the
two it did). `/interview` step 3d carries the same five steps for the agent's hand. It is not a skeleton to fill: a session checks a page against it in a minute,
and `/owner-reviews` says "run the shipped generator, do not build a contour". The generator itself ships
as three tool modules under `.kaif/tools/contour/` — `core.mjs` (parsing, records, pre-flight), `review.mjs`
(the page, the server, the call, the queue, the faces interview · notice · proofreading · mockup review, `--selftest`; since 2.7, epic IW — origin issue #64 — the server comes up on the previous run's port when that process is gone so the owner's browser draft is restored, names a taken port together with the loss, and the page reports when it lives in a tab instead of the app window; since 2.7, epic LP — origin issue #66 — `<doc> --close` is the only way to end a live page from outside: it reads the lock (port · pid · title · last input · draft state carried by the pulse) and refuses with exit 4 while the owner typed less than the quiet threshold ago, while the page is younger than it, or while a draft is unsaved — and it ends the page by asking the page's own server, never by killing a pid read from a file; the app window runs on its own browser profile in the project, `.kaif/contour-window/`, so an answer saved while the server was gone (IndexedDB is the primary carrier, durable half a second after the write) is picked up headless at the next queue, check or show — once no browser holds the profile — and recorded with `recovered: true`; an unknown flag refuses before any page, exit 1)
and `texts.mjs` (the RU/EN dictionaries and parser labels; other languages fall back to EN and the page says so) —
and reads every parameter from `.kaif/kaif.json`, never asking the owner.

Knowledge directories, each with its own README: `plans/` `ideas/` `bugs/` `researches/`
`interviews/` `homeworks/` `reports/`. Closed items take the `DONE` tag in the filename (§13.1);
research notes and reports are living records and are never tagged.

The documents divide into five tiers (the taxonomy canon lives in `AGENT_GUIDE.md` → Document
taxonomy): **KEY canon documents** — the re-read core of nine the agent re-reads on schedule
(`GOAL`, `AGENT_GUIDE`, `PHILOSOPHY`, `REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK`, `TESTING_FRAMEWORK`,
`BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK`, `STATUS`, `MASTER_PLAN`, `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP`) — a smaller
set than the fourteen shipped key documents above; **EXTENDED canon documents**, fetched on demand
by the context router; **WORKING canon documents** — the dynamic knowledge-directory documents,
each opening with the lintable header meta (H1 + `Created`/`Parent`/`Status`/`Outbound`, in the
project's working language); **OTHER KAIF documents** — the project's local "house rules"; and
**project working documents**, which belong to the owner's project, not to the framework.

## 6. The skill system

Thirty-seven skills — the verbs of project work — deploy to `.claude/skills/` (canonical) and are
mirrored into every declared agent system (§7.3). Groups:

- **Session:** `resume` (read ALL canon documents, pick one main thing) · `pause` (soft-park the
  chat: logical stopping point, green tree, local commit, NO pushes) · `end-chat-soft` (the unhurried full closure; since 2.7, epic SF — origin issue #67 — the farewell report answers `Standing falsehood: none` or names the statement and the places it was corrected in; the force closure carries the same line as one phrase) + `end-chat-force` (the urgent capture-and-go closure:
  STATUS handover, judge, commit AND push) · `refresh-context` · `check-backlog`.
- **Autonomy loops:** `autoloop` · `dayloop` · `nightloop` — grind the backlog; every item ends
  with a mandatory judge pass; an owner's drive-by note is filed to the backlog, not a task switch —
  plus `guarded-loop` (2.1): the same loop under a WATCHDOG (external wake-ups every N minutes,
  a work-proving heartbeat file, a restart policy with an escalation cap).
- **Knowledge:** `experience` · `report-bug` · `bug-research` · `propose-idea` · `interview`.
- **Owner contour (2.1):** `owner-voice` (a stylometric portrait of the owner's written voice from
  their own texts; portrait and rewrite modes, the skeleton ships as
  `.kaif/_owner-voice-template.md`, and the filled portrait lives at the project root as the
  optional `AUTHOR_STYLOMETRY.md`) · `owner-reviews` (the optional review contour: interviews and
  outbound drafts as local HTML pages, decisions recorded with `by`/`at`, sends gated fail-closed;
  the hard place-of-questions rule itself lives in AGENT_GUIDE).
- **Planning:** `plan-task` (one operational plan for an ordinary task; runs the heaviness test) ·
  `plan-epic` (the full ladder for heavy work: industry web-recon + local recon → research doc →
  meta-plan with phases → operational plan of the NEXT phase only).
- **Vision:** `revision` · `fix-vision` · `what-next` · `help-kaif` (reads THIS reference).
- **Canon writing:** `derive-styleguide` (§13.4).
- **Code quality (2.1):** `code-revision` — the periodic reading revision of the codebase by the
  strongest model: zoned parallel reviewers armed with the project's paid-for failure classes
  (EXPERIENCE + bugs), verbatim quote per finding, adversarial skeptic with the default verdict
  "not a defect"; survivors become bug docs and feed the guardrails. Since 2.2 the run also leaves
  audit reports in `reports/KAIF_AUDIT/` — one document per finding family plus a summary with the
  coverage map and the limits — and each finding is written as an eight-field contract a weaker
  model can execute (skeletons: the skill's `references/audit-report-template.md`). Rewritten by its
  executor in 2.7 (epic CR) and then proven by a functional run on a real zone: the reference now
  carries the reviewer and skeptic briefs and the effective-FP procedure, the newest summary that IS
  a revision is named as the run's baseline, and the seven places where the executor stopped were
  fixed in the text.
- **Shipping:** `release` (owner-confirmed only).
- **Execution discipline (vendored from fable-method, MIT):** `fable-method` · `fable-loop` ·
  `fable-judge` · `fable-domain`.
- **Lifecycle:** `kaif-version` · `kaif-update` · `kaif-fork` · `kaif-switch-origin` —
  origin-tied, skipped on anonymous deployments — plus `kaif-remove`, which is NOT origin-tied
  and ships on every deployment (removal must stay available to an anonymous owner too). Their
  headers state the current mechanical command first: an adopted copy of a lifecycle skill goes
  stale silently, and its staleness breaks the update itself — when prose and machinery disagree,
  the machinery and the origin release notes win.

## 7. Installation

### 7.1 The thin pipeline

`KAIF.md` (3 bootstrap steps with `KAIF-BOOT:` checkpoints) → the agent writes `KAIF-LOADER.mjs`
verbatim and runs it → the loader fetches `kaif-manifest.json` + the machinery pair, verifies
sha256 (a mismatch never installs) → hands over to `kaif-core.mjs install`.

### 7.2 What install does

Parses the bundle; applies the language pack (`--lang`; §7.4); autofills the canonical
placeholders from project reality (package.json, git config, LICENSE); writes files respectfully
(`writeIfNew`: an existing non-empty file is ADOPTED, never clobbered); deploys per-system skill
mirrors; wires the marker, npm handles and the deploy manifest (v2, §12.2); writes ONE cognitive
deliverable — `KAIF_ADAPTATION_TASK.md`, whose items close only via `checkpoint <id>` commands
(the `field-report` item requires the mandatory field install report to exist in
`reports/KAIF_UPDATES/` before it ticks; the `owner-voice` item closes the voice-portrait
question BEFORE any owner-facing text is written — portrait installed, or a canonical
`no voice portrait` line recorded in the deployed AGENT_GUIDE); `verify-final` runs the final
gates (§7.5) and self-cleans the installer.

### 7.3 Agent systems

Declared via `--agents` (default: claude-code, codex, grok-build, cline, zoo-code). The canonical
skill set lives in `.claude/skills/`; mirrors derive from it mechanically (`sync` command;
`update-verify` re-syncs automatically). Cognitive work lands in the canon only — a mirror is
never edited by hand.

### 7.4 Languages

Two language packs are MAINTAINED: `en` (the source language itself) and `ru`. The other eight —
es, pt, fr, de, zh-Hans, ja, hi, ar — are FROZEN at their full KAIF 2.2 state (owner's decision
#56, named in the open: nine parallel packs are heavy to maintain and do not yet pay for
themselves). A frozen pack STAYS in the bundle and deploys exactly as it did in 2.2 — the
owner-facing documents plus skill trigger aliases — but receives no updates with new releases;
its byte state is pinned by the origin's guard, so silent degradation cannot ride a release. A
frozen pack is REVIVED on community demand: open an issue at the origin. Deploying with one stays
legal, and the install log says its status honestly.

A pack overrides the owner-facing documents and injects trigger aliases into each skill's
`description:`. Agent documents stay English by default. A project that translated its wrapper
wholesale declares `"i18n": "translated"` in the marker: mechanical replacement is then disabled
in favor of per-module diffs, and the machinery never wars with the translation (§10.2).

### 7.5 The final gates

One sequence for every road (`verify-final` = `update-verify`): checkpoint grep (the judge tick
requires its verdict line) → placeholder scan across ALL deployed surfaces → anonymity leak scan
(§11.3) → marker self-heal from the manifest snapshot → mirror re-sync → disk-sha re-snapshot →
self-clean. Guarantees are a property of the deployed tree, not of the road taken to it.

## 8. The bundle

### 8.1 FILE blocks

Each deployable file travels as `> **FILE: \`<dest>\`**` + a six-backtick fence. The label is law:
the block's destination path is exact.

### 8.2 The meta block

`kaif-bundle-manifest.json` — data for the machinery, never written to disk: `version`,
`released`, `templateNotes` (current release), `templateNotesByVersion` (per-release news, printed
as the UNION of the update interval), `deprecations` (artifacts retired by this release, §10.5),
`moduleClasses` (manual class overrides), `policyChanges` (§10.6), `renamesByVersion` (headings
renamed by a release — §9.3).

## 9. The module map

### 9.1 Generation

The build cuts every deployable markdown file into modules by signature anchors (headings outside
code fences; duplicate signatures fail the build) and emits `kaif-module-map.json`: for each file,
the ordered list of `{signature, class, sha256, lines}`. Classes are COMPUTED — owner-seeded
files → `owner`; a module carrying a canonical placeholder, or a skill frontmatter → `adaptive`;
all else → `static` — with rare manual overrides in `module-classes.json`. The build's splitter
and the machinery's vendored copy are pinned to identical behavior by an executed check on every
build.

### 9.2 Guarantees

Split-and-rejoin is byte-identical for every file (the build fails otherwise). The map is
validated against the bundle by re-splitting; a stale or tampered map fails the self-check.

### 9.3 Renamed headings (2.7)

A module's address is its signature — the full heading line — so renaming a heading looks, to an
update, exactly like removing one module and adding another. That ambiguity is not resolved by
guessing (neither does any migration system: an explicit declaration is the industry's answer), so
a release DECLARES its renames in the meta block: `renamesByVersion` → `{ '<version>': { '<template
dest>': [['<old heading>', '<new heading>'], …] } }`, applied over the `(from, to]` interval like
policy changes, with both hops of a twice-renamed heading kept so a tree that skipped one release
still finds its own. The merge binds each target to the hop that is actually ON DISK and then
treats the pair as ONE module: untouched → replaced under the new heading; carrying local edits →
your section stays, with ONE heading and a task item naming the rename; old anchor absent → a log
line by name, never a failure. Every outcome is logged as `renamed: <path> :: <old> → <new>`,
because silence leaves the owner unable to tell a rename from a delete-plus-add. The build warns
by name when a heading vanished from a template since the previous release with neither a rename
nor a deprecation behind it. The first hop INTO a release that declares a rename is the exception: that
update is run by the DEPLOYED older core, which does not read the map, so a section the owner edited under a
renamed heading arrives twice and the update task names it as "upstream removed" — the release notes and
the task tell the owner to fold it by hand once (2.6 → 2.7: `/end-chat-soft` and `/end-chat-force` Step 1,
`/code-revision` Step 0).

## 10. Updating

### 10.1 Classification

For every bundle file, against the deployment's snapshots: an owner file is never in scope (but a
changed owner TEMPLATE surfaces as an "owner-conventions" task item); a missing file is added; a
file whose disk sha equals its TEMPLATE sha is replaced (or kept if upstream did not change it);
a diverged markdown file undergoes the MODULAR merge. Equality is judged MODULO the hand-filled
slots (2.6, origin issue #48): a file that differs from its template only by the values the
adaptation task filled into slots the machinery could not fill (`npm run build`, `npm test`,
the co-author line) is untouched — the replacement carries those fills into the new template, and
a deprecated file of that shape retires mechanically. The fills are DERIVED from the disk (the
template matched as a pattern with one capture per slot; the proof is the exact sha of the disk
text with the fills folded back), cached in the deploy manifest as `fills`, never asked of anyone.

### 10.2 The modular merge

Reconstruction starts from the DISK order (the owner's inserted sections keep their place).
A module untouched since deploy takes the new template's text; a localized module is never
replaced by a template that carries none of the owner's script; an edited module is kept — and
lands in the task WITH a "your version → new template" diff ONLY when upstream actually changed
it (2.6: a module already equal to the incoming template — the deploy values healed since, e.g.
by `project-name` — is nothing to hand over and makes no item; the comparison is by the FILLED
texts, because the manifest keeps no raw template texts and the healing rewrites the fill map).
New template modules insert by template order. A file whose body carries the owner's
script prints its verdict WITH the numbers that produced it — `baseFound N of M, ceiling K →
frozen | merged` (2.5: a rehearsal and the live run compare line by line, not by outcome).
The H1 is OUT of that count (2.5, origin bug 100): it is the one heading that carries a deploy-time
value, and a synthetic baseline fills it from whatever the folder resolves to — one tree under two
folder names once got two verdicts, ±1 at the ceiling; the polygon now runs exactly that and
demands one verdict. The rehearsal is BINDING (2.5, origin issue #27 R1): `diff --source` prints the same verdicts
over the same candidate set (2.6: ONE predicate for both — an md file neither owner-seeded nor
skipped by anonymity — so the rehearsal file and the receipt count the same files; origin issue
#42) and records them in `.kaif/update-rehearsal.json`; the next `update` over that tree (or one
given `--rehearsal <receipt>` from a sandbox copy — on the bootstrap route the same flag rides the
loader's line into `install`, 2.6, and the auto record is consumed on both routes) freezes any file whose
live verdict is `merged` where the rehearsal said `frozen` — kept intact, the template delta in
the task, both number sets in the `verdict-mismatch` item — so what the rehearsal showed the
owner stays true; every candidate's verdict also rides the receipt (`verdicts`), and a record
for another version interval is named and ignored.
Anchored blocks — `<!-- KAIF:NAME:BEGIN -->` … `<!-- KAIF:NAME:END -->` (the creed, the prayer)
— are indivisible units (2.5, origin issue #27): the merge plan is judged as a whole, and a
pair that was balanced on disk but would come out unbalanced (its markers live in different
modules — one carrier applied, the other kept) rolls every changed carrier back to the disk
state and lands in the task as ONE item, `(anchored block KAIF:NAME)`, with the diff of all its
carriers; a NEW module whose insertion point falls inside a pair open on disk is inserted after
the module that closes it (a localized prayer cut into the owner's headings never receives
upstream text between its markers); a pair already broken on disk is not rolled back — the item
names it, and `check` reddens the document with the weight of a two-headed document until it is
restored by hand.

### 10.3 The update task

`KAIF_UPDATE_TASK.md` lists: per-module merges with diffs · whole-file merges (a
translated-wholesale file also names its UPSTREAM path and a ready `git diff v<from> v<to> --
<src>` — the dest → src map ships in the bundle meta as `sources`, 2.5) · owner-convention
transfers · deprecations carrying local edits (every deprecation names its SUCCESSOR in the log
and in the item, and the kept ones are counted in the task's context line and the receipt —
2.5, origin issue #32 R-D) · stale claims (lines asserting ANY version older than the one being
installed — not only the one just replaced: a one-version window let a README badge two releases
back survive three green updates, so a line stuck on an earlier version now names it, `(asserts
2.2)`, 2.6, origin issue #44 — anywhere in the project: prose AND the project's own scripts: `package.json`,
`*.mjs/js/ts/sh/ps1/py/yml/toml`, lock files excluded, 2.5; the item is UNCONDITIONAL on a
version change — an empty scan says `no lines found`, so a silent scanner failure can never pass
as a clean tree, 2.5) ·
language arrivals (NEW files of the release that arrived English on a non-English deployment,
2.5) · verdict mismatches (files frozen because the recorded rehearsal's wholesale verdict
differed from this run's — both number sets named, 2.5) · mode switch (on an anonymous →
origin transition, the kept files that were deployed with the anonymous wording — named for a
re-read, 2.5) · the news interval · executing
checkpoints (`recheck` runs the
actual check; `judge` requires `--verdict` with evidence; `field-report` demands the mandatory
field update report on disk in `reports/KAIF_UPDATES/`, pinned to the delivered version — an
update does not verify green without its report).

### 10.4 Legacy and anonymous roads

A bootstrap over an existing deployment classifies exactly like an update whenever a baseline
exists: the surviving deploy manifest, or a synthetic baseline fetched from the OLD version's own
release artifact (`--baseline` overrides the source; unreachable baseline falls back to classic
adopt-everything, stated aloud). Agents and language are inherited from the marker; a re-run never
clobbers recorded checkpoints.

### 10.5 Deprecations

A release may retire artifacts earlier releases deployed: untouched instances are removed
mechanically; locally edited ones are listed in the task. The mechanism that replaced another owns
the cleanup of its predecessor.

### 10.6 Policy changes

A release that CHANGES A RULE of the previous version (not merely its wording) declares it in the
meta block's `policyChanges`, keyed by version. The update task prints them in a separate
"decisions for the OWNER" section: a policy change is never merged silently as an ordinary diff.

### 10.7 Commands

`update` (mechanical pass; writes a crash journal before its first tree mutation and removes it
as its last act — a run killed mid-flight stays visible) · `resume` (after a crashed update:
restore the pre-update tree byte-exact from the journal's backup, remove files the dead run
created, consume the journal) · `diff` (audit: protected vs replace-eligible; `--source`:
per-module preview against another version — a v1 manifest gets a synthetic baseline of the
deployed version, `--baseline` overrides its source; a bare `github.com/<owner>/<repo>` source
resolves to its latest-release assets) · `adopt-current` (after a MANUAL migration: re-adopt
reality so the mechanical road stays alive) · `sync` (re-mirror skills) · `modules` (print the
machinery's module cut) · `checkpoint` · `update-verify` · `check` (since 2.7, epic SD — origin issue #65 — also the axis "undelivered signal", an allowlist: on tracking: origin a numbered `bugs/KAIF/NN_*.md` ticket is silent only when its `Delivered upstream:` line names an issue — a `…/issues/N` URL or `#NN` — and does not say NOT YET; NOT YET is named with the ready `report` command, a missing, translated or unreadable line, or NOT YET beside an issue, as "no readable delivery state" with both legal forms; a warning, read by the same function as `report`) · (since 2.7, epic FR — origin issue #68 — also the axis "constitution keeps the obligations of its template": with a `TEAM_CONSTITUTION.md` in the root and the skill's template on disk, every bold anchor of § 2's numbered items and every one of the nine `## N.` headings must survive generation — headings matched by NUMBER, rules by anchor, and a document where not one anchor matches is translated, so the axis counts and says so; losses are named one by one, a warning never a failure, and `<!-- constitution-ok: <why> -->` beside the item is the declared exemption) · (since 2.7, epic CB — origin issues #43/#45/#71 — the size budgets of the re-read core are judged by the project's OWN lines: a disk module whose (signature, sha256) pair is in the deployment's `moduleShas` ARRIVED and is not counted, so a 1655-line `AGENT_GUIDE.md` with 300 arrived lines is judged at 1355; the warning carries `own lines N of budget ~M` and the ADDRESS the overflow moves to, taken per document from `DOC_BUDGETS` — the chronicle for `STATUS.md`, the chronicle · `researches/` · a house-rules file for the rest; three fallbacks name themselves in the line instead of going silent — no module cut for the file, a file translated WHOLESALE (not one template signature survives, so a by-signature cut is impossible by construction) and an OWNER-SEEDED document whose shipped skeleton the project wrote over, all three counting every line as the project's own; `--gate-budgets` turns the advice into a DOOR — exit 1 after every other axis has spoken, one `<document>: own lines N of budget M → <address>` line each, while the bare `check` keeps the warning and exit 0 so no update road fails on a long document; the closing ritual `/end-chat-soft` runs the flag. The same epic judges the SKILL LANGUAGE MIX by the share of foreign-script prose tokens instead of a single occurrence of a script — fenced blocks and inline code spans are not prose, a body with not one token in the owner's script is ENGLISH as before, and a body that keeps the owner's script while at or above the named threshold of its tokens are foreign is a MIX, named with its percentage: a fully English skill carrying three stray localized words used to be invisible to both counts) · `version` · `report
<ticket>` (2.5, epic SG: deliver a `bugs/KAIF/` ticket to the origin through `gh` under the KAIF
owner's standing authorization — origin issue #15 — with an authorship trailer, and write the
issue URL into its `Delivered upstream:` line; refusals named: `tracking: anonymous`, no `gh`,
not a ticket, `gh` refused; a timeout of the CREATE call is OUTCOME UNKNOWN, exit 3, never a
refusal — a hanging `gh auth status` is `not ready`, exit 2: nothing was sent, a repeat is safe
(2.6 wording, court RL 2.5); the contract line is read as a PARAGRAPH — an issue in it (a
`…/issues/N` URL, or `#NN` as the value itself or right after the word origin/issue) with no
`not yet` is delivered (idempotent), `not yet` in any case with
no issue is undelivered, both at once is ambiguous and refused, and a refusal names both legal
forms with the exact edit (2.6, origin issue #40; since 2.7 one function reads it for `report` and
`check`, and a URL that is not an issue no longer counts); `--dry-run`
calls nothing; the `KAIF_GH` seam lets a polygon stand in for `gh`).

### 10.8 Predicting a pass

The cheapest *exact* prediction is a **sandbox copy**: export the tree (`git archive`), re-init git
in the copy, run the REAL update or bootstrap there and read its diff. This is not a model of the
pass but the pass itself — field-proven byte-identical to the subsequent live run. Recommended
before the first-ever update and on heavily localized deployments; `diff --source` remains the
lighter per-module preview. The copy's receipt binds the live run on EITHER route (2.6): `update
--rehearsal <receipt>` or `node KAIF-LOADER.mjs --lang <code> --rehearsal <receipt>` — the loader
validates its flags BEFORE any download (`--lang --mode --agents --baseline --force --rehearsal`
ride to `install`, `--channel --source` are its own; anything else is refused with nothing fetched
and nothing written — origin issue #42 found three trees left with a new core under an old marker).
On the bootstrap route the task renders module diffs with the OLD template texts (`−`/`+`, never
`+` alone): the machinery fetches the previous release's own artifact for them, `--baseline
<dir|url>` offline (2.6, origin issue #41).

## 11. Trust and provenance

### 11.1 Receipts and history

Every update writes the receipt (`.kaif/last-update.json`: from→to, route, counters, per-module
divergences; `update-verify` stamps `verifiedAt`) and appends to the marker's `history`. An update
is provable after the fact, forever.

### 11.2 Snapshot provenance

The deploy manifest keeps `templateShas` (what the framework deployed) apart from `shas` (what
lies on disk, refreshed post-merge). Authority to replace derives ONLY from template shas; hence
an adaptation that survived one update cannot die in the next. Template and module hashes are
EOL-normalized; the disk snapshot (`shas`) is byte-exact.

### 11.3 Install mode: origin by default, anonymity on request

The install mode defaults to `standard`, which records `tracking: "origin"` together with the
origin URL: version checks, respectful updates and the feedback loop are available to a fresh
deployment without further configuration. Anonymity is never reached by default — only by the
explicit flag. The default is guarded by the sandbox polygon (suite `s01`), which asserts the
marker of a flag-free install rather than the wording of the help text: help is prose, the marker
is behaviour.

`--mode anonymous`: origin-tied skills are skipped, author regions stripped, the acronym
de-expanded; no origin field, no core kept after self-clean. The deploy manifest carries no origin
and SURVIVES — the next bootstrap classifies mechanically. The leak scan covers only
machinery-deployed paths and excludes token clusters matching the project owner's own identity:
the owner's name is not a leak.

## 12. Schemas

### 12.1 The marker (`.kaif/kaif.json`)

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `framework` | Always `"KAIF"`. |
| `version`, `released` | Deployed version and its release date. |
| `tracking` | `"origin"` (the default, §11.3) or `"anonymous"`. |
| `origin` | The origin URL (absent on anonymous). |
| `sphere` | The project's sphere; its library shall exist at `.kaif/spheres/<sphere>.md`. |
| `agents` | The declared agent systems (array). |
| `language` | The owner's working language. |
| `i18n` | Optional: `"translated"` — the wrapper is translated wholesale (§7.4); updates record it automatically when the translation net recognizes translated files on a non-English deployment. |
| `canonArtifacts` | Declared owner canon paths for the provenance module (§13.3). Seeded `[]` at deploy/update — the conscious "no canon yet" state; a MISSING key makes the provenance gate exit 3 "SKIPPED". |
| `aiMarks` | Optional: localized provenance mark pairs as open tags in the owner's script (the `[AI]`/`[AI-ed]` analogs a translated wrapper uses, two entries); closers are derived by inserting `/`, and the English pair always works. Literal examples live in the tool's header, not here — an EN template body must stay free of owner-script text (§7.4's translation net judges bodies). |
| `history` | Update history: `{from, to, route, date}` entries; `date` is a moment — local ISO 8601 with the offset (§12.3). |

Commands never require the CLI to restate what the marker already records. The marker is edited
only through commands (`sphere`, updates) — never by hand.

### 12.2 The deploy manifest (`.kaif/deploy-manifest.json`)

`manifestVersion: 2` · `paths` (deployed files) · `agents` (per-system artifacts) · `shas` (disk
snapshot) · `templateShas` (deployed-template snapshot) · `moduleShas` (per-module cut:
signature/class/sha per markdown file) · `kept` (adoption provenance) · `values` (the deploy-time
placeholder snapshot — every later pass fills templates with THESE values, so signatures never
drift when the environment changes; to rename the project deliberately, edit this snapshot and
reconcile the canon by hand) · `marker` (pristine marker snapshot backing self-heal).

### 12.3 The receipt (`.kaif/last-update.json`)

`from`, `to`, `route` (`core-update` | `legacy-bootstrap`), `date`, `counters`, `diverged`,
`divergedModules`, `ownerConvention`, `judgeVerdict` (the full judge verdict recorded by
`checkpoint judge` — the committable proof of the update's judging), `verifiedAt` (stamped by
`update-verify`). `date` and `verifiedAt` are MOMENTS, so both carry the time and the offset in
the owner's local clock — full ISO 8601 (`2026-08-08T07:13:00+03:00`), never a bare date: on a
day carrying two updates a date-only receipt cannot say which one it proves.

### 12.4 The crash journal (`.kaif/update-journal.json`)

Written by `update` (and a version-moving bootstrap) after the pre-update backup and BEFORE the
first tree mutation; removed as the run's last act. `from`, `to`, `source`, `route`,
`startedAt` (a moment, §12.3 convention), `backupDir`, `born` (paths the run will create). A run
killed mid-flight therefore leaves either an untouched tree or a visible journal — never a
half-updated tree without a trace. While the journal exists, `update` and the bootstrap refuse
and name `resume`, which restores every backed-up file byte-exact, removes the `born` files and
consumes the journal. Git-ignored (ignore-first): it is transient run state, not history.

## 13. Conventions

1. **The DONE tag.** A closed bug/idea/homework is renamed `NN_DONE_…` with a status section;
   closing anything requires the "Decisions made without the owner" section.
2. **Test-status markers.** Everything non-trivial is born `[NOT-TESTED]` and becomes
   `[TESTED: date · how]` only by observation. A false `[TESTED]` is judge-hunted fraud.
3. **Provenance marks.** AI text in an owner canon artifact carries paired `[AI]…[/AI]` /
   `[AI-ed]…[/AI-ed]` marks; only the owner's word removes them. Mechanized by the optional
   module `.kaif/tools/kaif-provenance.mjs` (`check` / `report` / `accept`); the owner declares
   the canon via `canonArtifacts`. For machine-consumed canon (prompts, configs), the mark's
   carrier is the accompanying document, never the artifact itself.
4. **Strictness modes.** `draft` — fast, outside the canon; `canon` — the full pipeline:
   approved styleguide (`/derive-styleguide`) → marked writing → canon linter green
   (`.kaif/tools/kaif-canon-lint.mjs`, guards proven by `selftest`) → provenance gate → the
   owner's acceptance. Mechanical steps run on any model; judgment steps on a strong one.
5. **Judge before push.** A `/fable-judge` pass precedes every push and deploy.

## 14. Optional tool modules

Shipped to `.kaif/tools/`, active only when the project opts in:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kaif-provenance.mjs` | The acceptance gate for AI text in owner canon (§13.3). |
| `kaif-canon-lint.mjs` | The growing canon linter: revoked decision → forbidden wording; accepted decision → guarded full unique line; `selftest` proves every guard can fire. |
| `kaif-requirements-lint.mjs` | The stop-word dictionary of `REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md` as an advisory grep guard over requirement sections (`check` / `selftest`); quotes, ❌ examples, code, and `(justified: …)` lines are legal by construction. |
| `kaif-guard-lint.mjs` | The guard-declaration block of `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` gate 5 (second half, 2.5) as an advisory linter (`check` / `selftest`): every `@guard` carries `THREAT` · `PROVED-AGAINST` · `GAP` · `ON-REAL-PATH`, every `@forensic` carries `EXPLAINS` · `DURABLE-AT` (with `close` / `exit` / `trip-only` rejected), every `@fork` carries `OPTIONS` · `COST` · `RECON` · `DECIDED`; fires only on explicit markers, `SKIPPED=3` when a tree carries none. |
| `kaif-scenario-lint.mjs` | The scenario form of an acceptance criterion (`REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md` → "The scenario form", 2.5) as an advisory linter (`check` / `selftest`): a started four-line scenario — Situation · Action · Result · Check, keywords mirrored per language — keeps its shape under seven rules-as-data (order · one action · observable result · no implementation words · third person · a runnable Check · concrete values); an empty owner-written Check is a warning; never demands a scenario, `SKIPPED=3` when a tree carries none. |
| `kaif-attribution-lint.mjs` | The authorship of a decision (`AGENT_GUIDE.md` → "Authorship of a decision", 2.7, epic AW; origin issue #55 — an agent's own choice recorded as "the owner's decision" held a run while the owner's machine died) as an advisory linter (`check [paths…] [--write-baseline]` / `selftest`): a line that attributes a decision or an order to the owner ("the owner's decision", "the owner decided", their RU forms) must carry a verbatim quote, an interview address or a decision number within ±2 lines, or be signed as the agent's own (`[AI]`, the localized pair) — otherwise it is DEBT, counted against a baseline that only shrinks (`.kaif/attribution-lint.baseline.json`); patterns are data per language; quote lines, fenced code, inline code and ❌ examples are invisible; `SKIPPED=3` on a tree with no markdown in scope. |
| `kaif-testrun-lint.mjs` | The run report of `TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md` → "An executed run produces its report" (2.7, epic TR; origin issue #59 — the owner-QA's word "THERE WAS NO TESTING") as an advisory linter (`check [home]` / `selftest`): every report in `<testdocs>/reports/` is named `<YYYY-MM-DD>_<work>.md` (the date-first name is the index) and carries seven non-empty fields — Work · Contour · Runs (a moment and a command in a code span per run) · Checks (opening with two separate lines, `Hygiene:` and `Functional run:` — a Verdict `pass` whose Checks carry no functional run or say `NONE` reddens: hygiene alone is `partial`; 2.7, epic CL, origin issue #62) · Found (a list or an explicit "none") · Traces · Verdict (pass · fail · blocked · partial); rules as data, keywords per language, placeholders are not content; `SKIPPED=3` when the home has no `reports/` — an unwritten report is invisible to it, and the judge hunts the claim without one. |
| `kaif-voice-lint.mjs` | The machine minute of the owner's voice portrait (`AUTHOR_STYLOMETRY.md` §7A/§8) — the machine half of the INDEPENDENT check that follows writing BY the portrait (`AGENT_GUIDE.md` → the fable loop's fourth KAIF obligation: written by the portrait → checked independently by it → fixed → only then written and brought to the owner; "Showing is an action"; 2.7, epic VC; origin issue #61 — a field agent rewrote a player sheet through seven rounds under the owner's eyes without opening the portrait once) as an advisory tool (`load [--sections <regex>]` / `check <files…> [--warn]` / `selftest`): `load` prints the portrait into the agent's working context BEFORE the first word and leaves the witness `.kaif/voice-marker.json` (the owner's word: write BY the stylometry, with it in the working cache); `check` refuses a text with no witness, with a witness for another portrait, last written before the first load or more than an hour after the last load ("written past the portrait" — never muted by `--warn`) and runs the stop-patterns and required positives of the portrait's §8 TABLE (pattern · class · hint · exception — `\|` is alternation, a bare pattern is case-sensitive, `/…/i` folds case, `\b`/`\w` are Unicode-aware) over the written text before it counts as written; every hit is printed with the portrait's own hint, a row's `/regex/` exception silences a hit on its line and prose is printed beside it; fenced code, inline code and HTML comments are invisible; `--warn` is the calibration mode; `SKIPPED=3` without a portrait, without a §8 table or with placeholder rows only — likeness is never judged, that verdict is the owner's; the portrait path may be named in `.kaif/kaif.json` → `voicePortrait`. |
| `kaif-ranking-lint.mjs` | The fixed form of a `/what-next` answer (2.6, epic WN; origin issue #53 — a field agent quoted "the newest pain is not a priority claim" and broke it in the same answer) as an advisory linter (`check <draft.md>` / `selftest`): the answer opens with `METRIC:` and `MAIN PHASE:` read from the documents, ranks steps in a `| step | moves | closes | effort |` table where row 1 moves the metric or closes something, keeps the fresh words of the owner on a shelf "not ranked by the metric", and always carries the tech-debt line — seven rules-as-data, RU/EN anchors, SKIPPED (exit 3) on a document that never started an answer. |
| `kaif-experience-lint.mjs` | The recurrence deadline of `EXPERIENCE.md` — "Two strikes → a mechanism, never a third reminder" (2.7, epic EL; origin issue #69 — a field audit of one project's whole journal: 7 of 120 failure entries mechanized, 14 of 15 failure classes recurred AFTER their lesson was written, five lessons written 6–17 times in different words) as an advisory linter (`check [journal] [--baseline <file>]` / `--shrink EXP-NNNN [journal] [--yes]` / `selftest`): the field `class: <slug>` on its own line under the entry heading is the UNIT of recurrence, and the SECOND failure entry (`❌` or `❌→✅`) of one class with no `mechanized:` is a finding that names the class and BOTH entries by id. Two fates clear it, both written: `mechanized: <the tool>` in the entry, or the price of the WHOLE class re-checked and declared beside the list — `<!-- class-ok: <slug> — <why it is not cheaply possible> -->` (an empty declaration is itself a finding; declared classes are printed on the summary line and that list only shrinks). It also carries the field rules of the origin's own guard (exactly one of `mechanized:` / `none-cheap: <why>` / `subject-lesson`; a trap by form may not answer `subject-lesson`) against an inherited-debt baseline the caller passes, warns when `mechanized:` names a command or path the project does not contain (a path the project IGNORES is not dangling, and addresses are not checked at all for a journal outside a project tree — said aloud) and when a slug is outside the journal's class list; `--shrink` collapses a MECHANIZED entry to its class line plus one pointer line (`Lesson → guard: … · repro … · full text: git log -p -S "<id>"`), showing by default and writing only with `--yes`; `SKIPPED=3` when not one entry carries `class:` — recurrence cannot be counted, and "not judged" never reads as "clean". Keywords are a per-language table; ids are not assumed numeric (a field journal writes `EXP-NEW-<slug>`). |

A sibling optional module ships to `.kaif/hooks/` (2.2, epic O) — the **refresh-hooks module**:
mechanical injections of the context-refresh canon (`AGENT_GUIDE.md` → Context refresh) for
agent systems with lifecycle hooks. Four scripts speaking the Claude Code hook contract —
`session-start-refresh.mjs` (canon order after compaction/clear), `prompt-refresh-timer.mjs`
(refresh-marker age over 60 minutes → refresh order; silent while fresh),
`stop-status-guard.mjs` (work happened while `STATUS.md` went stale → one soft block per
session), `prompt-resume-word.mjs` (2.7, epic RS: the prompt's FIRST word is `resume` or its Russian shorthand → the
order to run `/resume` in full before the work; silent on every other message — Claude Code only,
other systems' prompt field not verified) — plus `settings-fragment.json`, the ready sample config. Every hook carries a
predicate and a cooldown; injections are orders to re-read, never document bodies. Activation
is an explicit owner opt-in (`.kaif/hooks/README.md`): the machinery never edits the project's
`settings.json`, and a deployment without hooks never reddens — the markdown ritual is the
complete contour on its own.

**Portability across agent systems** (phase O5; contracts read in each vendor's live docs on
2026-08-07). The predicate and the order text are system-independent; only the JSON envelope of
the injection differs, so each script takes `--emit <shape>` and the SAMPLE names the shape
explicitly — never auto-detection, because a hook must exit silently on anything unclear and a
wrong guess would therefore fail invisibly. Four samples ship beside the reference one:
`sample-codex-hooks.json` (identical field names — the scripts run unchanged),
`sample-cursor-hooks.json`, `sample-copilot-hooks.json`, `sample-antigravity-hooks.json`. Grok
Build needs none — it reads `.claude/settings.json` directly. Where a system's contract carries
only one hook of three, the sample ships that one and says why in its own `_readme`; where a
system cannot inject agent-facing context at all (Windsurf/Cascade, Cline), no sample ships and
the markdown ritual is the honest answer. The module README holds the per-system table, and the
adapters (`_index.md` → "Hook support") hold the same survey from the agent-system side.

## 15. Lifecycle

- `kaif-version` — the deployed version; check origin for newer releases.
- `kaif-update` — the mechanical respectful update (§10); the cognitive residue is the task file.
- `kaif-fork` — snapshot the evolved KAIF into the user's own repository and track it. A fork IS
  an origin only when it PUBLISHES A RELEASE carrying the three machinery artifacts
  (`kaif-manifest.json`, `KAIF-CORE.mjs`, `KAIF-CORE-BUNDLE.md`): `update` fetches from
  `releases/latest/download`, and a repository without a release yields 404. Verification is one
  command: `node .kaif/kaif-core.mjs update --source <fork>/releases/latest/download` shall
  answer with a version or "already up to date" — never 404.
- `kaif-switch-origin` — return tracking to the official origin.
- `kaif-remove` — respectful removal: partial (knowledge artifacts stay) or full.

## 16. Where to read more

The living showcase is the origin README. The execution discipline is documented inside the
`fable-*` skills. The requirements canon is `REQUIREMENTS_FRAMEWORK.md`; the testing canon is
`TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md`; the debugging canon is `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md` — bugs are what is born
when testing's checks run against what the requirements demanded. The thinking canon is
`PHILOSOPHY.md`. This reference documents the FRAMEWORK; the project's own architecture lives in
the project's two maps.
