// kaif-voice-lint.mjs — the OPTIONAL owner-voice tool (2.7, epic VC; AGENT_GUIDE.md → the fable loop's
// fourth KAIF obligation and "Showing is an action"; origin issue #61 — the owner's word: "that you write
// texts and do not use the stylometry is a GLARING methodology bug"). Deployed to .kaif/tools/.
//
// The owner's contract it serves (his statement, rendered from Russian): the agent WRITES the text by the
// voice and the rules the owner's stylometry prescribes — WITH THE STYLOMETRY IN ITS WORKING CACHE — then,
// by that same stylometry, runs an INDEPENDENT check of what it wrote, fixes it, and only then counts the
// text as written and brings it to the owner. Two commands, one for each half:
//   load  — prints the portrait (AUTHOR_STYLOMETRY.md) into the agent's working context BEFORE the first
//           word and leaves the witness .kaif/voice-marker.json (the moments are taken by the tool from the
//           system clock; the marker is session state, ignored by git like the refresh marker). Since 2.8
//           (epic CK; origin issue #99 p. 3 — a field portrait weighed ~170k tokens and was loaded whole for
//           every unit) a bare `load` prints the WRITING sections: the head before the first H2 and the H2
//           sections numbered 0 · 1 · 2 · 5 · 6 · 7 (2.8 epic VO: + §1; `--genre essay` + §3) with their subsections — 2-C among them (the owner's bans, the
//           rules, the lexicon, the anti-portrait, the before/after pairs, the checklist), prints what that costs in tokens, and names
//           every section it left out with its weight and a ready ASCII-only `--sections` command; `--all`
//           prints the whole portrait; a portrait with no numbered writing section is printed whole, said aloud;
//   check — the MACHINE HALF of the independent check: the stop-patterns and required positives the
//           portrait keeps as a TABLE in §8, run over the written text; plus the witness — a text with no
//           load witness, last written BEFORE the portrait was first loaded, or written MORE THAN AN HOUR
//           after the last load (the hour rule of context refresh: the portrait had left the working
//           context), is "written past the portrait" and a finding. The semantic half is the
//           clean-instance pass §7B (not this module).
// The portrait is the single source of the patterns (the owner edits them where he reads them); this
// module carries no pattern of its own, and `check` is not the writing step.
//
// What it does NOT do, said aloud: it does not judge likeness — "sounds like the owner" is the taste
// class and the owner's verdict (AGENT_GUIDE.md → the taste class); it catches only the EXPLICIT patterns
// of the portrait's §8 table. It never lints the portrait itself (every pattern would hit its own row).
// A portrait whose §8 is prose is honestly SKIPPED — a silent green over an unread §8 would be a false
// check, which is the very class this module exists to close. And the witness is a MARKER, with the
// marker class's boundary: it proves that `load` ran and when, not that the agent read what it printed —
// a copied marker or a re-saved file can forge it; the judge's re-run (open the named modules, compare
// the lexicon's turns with the text) is what judges the reading, exactly as with the refresh marker.
//
// The table (portrait §8; the skeleton .kaif/_owner-voice-template.md carries the form):
//   | pattern | class | hint | legal exception |      (RU header: паттерн · класс · подсказка · исключение)
//   pattern   — a regular expression in a code span, word forms spelled out for inflected languages;
//               `\|` inside the cell is alternation (GFM escapes the pipe); a bare pattern is case-sensitive
//               like ripgrep, `/…/i` opts into case-folding; `\b`, `\B` and `\w`/`\W` are Unicode-aware
//               here — JavaScript's own are blind to non-ASCII letters, a paid-for lesson (EXP-0082);
//               the one gap: `\W` INSIDE a character class stays ASCII (u-mode cannot nest a class) —
//               write `[^\p{L}\p{N}_]` there explicitly
//   class     — `stop` (a hit is a finding) or `positive` (its ABSENCE in the whole file is a warning)
//   hint      — what to write instead, in the owner's own words (printed with every hit)
//   exception — `/regex/` silences a hit whose LINE matches; prose is printed beside the hit for the reader
//   a row whose pattern cell is a placeholder `<…>` or empty is not a rule (the skeleton's example rows)
//
// The witness (.kaif/voice-marker.json): { at, firstAt, loads[], portrait, sha256, sections, lines } —
// `load` appends the moment to `loads` (a history, kept for one portrait path; a different portrait
// starts a new witness); `check` judges every file against it: no witness, or a witness for another
// portrait → finding; no load before the file's last write → finding; the last load before the write
// older than STALE_MINUTES → finding (the hour rule); the portrait changed since the last load (sha) →
// warning. `--warn` never mutes the witness — calibration is for patterns, not for the contract.
//
// Exit codes — ADVISORY, like the sibling modules: 1 = findings, 0 = judged and clean, 3 = SKIPPED (no
// portrait · no §8 section · no pattern table in §8 · a table with no rule — "not judged" must never read
// as "clean"), 2 = usage (no files, a named file missing, `--sections` without a value or matching no
// section, `--all` together with `--sections` — then nothing is loaded and no witness is written).
