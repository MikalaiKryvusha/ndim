// kaif-attribution-lint.mjs — the OPTIONAL authorship linter (2.7, epic AW; AGENT_GUIDE.md →
// "Authorship of a decision"; origin issue #55 — the owner's word, rendered from Russian: "you write
// some nonsense yourself, then read it back and interpret it as MY word"). Deployed to .kaif/tools/.
//
// What it mechanizes: a line that ATTRIBUTES a decision or a will to the owner — "the owner's
// decision", "решение владельца", "the owner decided", "владелец велел", or the owner's signature
// `[OWNER]` / `[ВЛАДЕЛЕЦ]` — must carry, within a window of WINDOW lines around it, one of:
//   · a verbatim quote of the owner — «…», “…” or "…" — or a `>` quote line;
//   · the address of the interview that holds the verbatim text — `interviews/…`, `интервью №NNN`,
//     `interview #NNN`, `interview_NNN`;
//   · the number of a RECORDED decision (`решение №109`, `decision #12`, `MASTER_PLAN §7 №95`) — a
//     number counts only with a registry word on the same line: a bare `№55` is an issue, a page, anything;
//   · ON THE ATTRIBUTION'S OWN LINE: the address of the commit that holds the owner's words verbatim — "commit" / «коммит»
//     next to a hash of 7+ hex digits with at least one digit (2.8, epic CK, origin issue #89: the rulebook takes the rule,
//     the verbatim words stay at the source — `[OWNER] <date> · verbatim in commit <hash>`);
//   · the declared exception on the line — `<!-- attribution-ok: <where the quote lives> -->`;
// or the line is signed as the AGENT's own decision ([AI] / [AI-ed] / the localized `aiMarks` pair of
// .kaif/kaif.json) — a signed agent decision is no attribution. A "Decisions made without the owner"
// section (any language — see SELF_SECTION) is the agent's signature block-wise: its lines are skipped.
//
// Why a linter and not a paragraph: the canon already said "quote the owner verbatim"; a prose rule
// holds until the session tires — in one deployment 430 of 1083 references to the owner's will carried
// no quote, and one of them ("the owner's decision P1: wait, no threshold" — his actual word was "do as
// you see fit") held a run for 119 s while the owner's machine died.
//
// Boundaries, so the linter never becomes bureaucracy:
//   · patterns are DATA per language (ATTRIBUTION) — a project adds a row, the engine does not change;
//   · invisible by construction: fenced code, `>` quote lines (they are EVIDENCE for their neighbours,
//     never findings themselves), inline code spans, HTML comments, lines carrying ❌ (the canon's own
//     counter-examples);
//   · DEBT, not a turnstile: findings already recorded in the baseline (.kaif/attribution-lint.baseline.json,
//     keys `file:sha16(line)`) are printed as debt and exit 0; only NEW findings exit 1; the baseline is
//     written once on adoption (`--write-baseline`) and ONLY SHRINKS after that: a rewrite that would turn
//     a NEW finding into debt is REFUSED (exit 1) unless `--adopt-new` is passed explicitly — the count of
//     adopted lines is printed, never silent; a baselined line that changed or vanished is pruned;
//   · exit 3 = SKIPPED: no markdown in scope — "not scanned" must never read as "clean" (bug 34 class);
//   · it cannot see an attribution phrased outside the table ("as agreed", "как договаривались"), it
//     cannot judge whether a quote is genuine, and non-markdown files (code comments) are out of scope —
//     those stay with `/fable-judge` (the hunt "an agent decision worn as the owner's word").
//
// Commands:
//   node .kaif/tools/kaif-attribution-lint.mjs check [paths…] [--write-baseline [--adopt-new]] [--baseline <file>]
//         # default paths: plans bugs ideas interviews researches homeworks reports + the root *.md

//         # PROVE both answers on in-memory fixtures (RU + EN): the field line without a quote → finding;
//         # with a quote / a `>` quote line / an interview address / a decision number / an agent signature /
//         # the marker → clean; the owner's signature without his words → finding; invisible zones stay
//         # silent; the baseline swallows old debt and reddens on a new line only.

// @guard kaif-attribution-lint
// THREAT:         an agent's own choice recorded as "the owner's decision" without his words becomes
//                 unrevisable and is obeyed by later sessions (origin #55: a run held for 119 s while
//                 the owner's machine died)
// PROVED-AGAINST: selftest — the field line «Решение владельца П1 (plans/81 §3): ЖДАТЬ, порога не
//                 заводить» with no quote within ±2 lines → 1 finding; the same line with «давай как ты
//                 считаешь» beside it → 0; the EN twin "the owner's decision P1: wait, no threshold" → 1;
//                 the ticket's own mutant «[ВЛАДЕЛЕЦ] без цитаты» → 1
// GAP:            an attribution phrased outside the pattern table is invisible; a fabricated quote
//                 passes as a quote (the judge's half); non-markdown files — code comments — are out of
//                 scope; an incidental quote or decision number within the window grounds a neighbour
