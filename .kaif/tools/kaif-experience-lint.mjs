// kaif-experience-lint.mjs — the OPTIONAL experience-journal linter (2.7, epic EL; EXPERIENCE.md
// header → "Two strikes → a mechanism, never a third reminder"; /experience step 0; origin issue
// #69 — a field audit of one project's whole journal: "7 of 120 failure entries mechanized (5.8 %),
// 14 of 15 failure classes recurred AFTER their lesson was written, 4 AFTER a guard was built, five
// lessons written 6–17 times in different words"). Deployed to .kaif/tools/.
//
// What it mechanizes: the journal's own deadline. The rule existed as PROSE plus one field on one
// entry, and nobody counted the RECURRENCE — tags are free, and "the same class" was visible only
// to a human who read the journal end to end (which is how the audit found it). This linter makes
// the class a UNIT: every entry carries `class: <slug>`, and the SECOND failure entry of one class
// with no `mechanized:` is a finding that names the class and both entries by id — the repair is to
// name the guard, never to write a third record.
//
// What it does NOT do, said aloud: it cannot tell a good class from a bad one — a wrong slug gives a
// false GREEN (two entries land in different classes), never a false red, so the marking may be
// imperfect and the axis stays honest; it does not judge whether a named guard actually prevents the
// class (that is the judge's re-run and the guard's own @guard block); and it never rewrites the
// journal by itself — `--shrink` shows, and writes only with `--yes`.
//
// Boundaries, so the linter never becomes bureaucracy:
//   · field keywords are a per-language table (like kaif-testrun-lint); a project adds a row;
//   · rules are DATA (one engine + rules-as-data): a new rule is a table row, not a new script;
//   · ADVISORY: exit 1 = findings, exit 0 = judged and clean, exit 3 = SKIPPED (not one `class:` in
//     the journal — "not judged" must never read as "clean");
//   · the class list in the journal's header (`<!-- classes: a, b, c -->` or a "Lesson classes"
//     section) is a CONTROLLED list, not a closed one: a slug outside it is a WARNING, never a
//     refusal — a new class is exactly what a new lesson brings;
//   · inherited field debt lives in a baseline the caller passes (`--baseline <file>`; the origin's
//     wrapper owns its own) and ONLY SHRINKS — an always-red guard teaches itself to be ignored.
//     The baseline covers the FIELD rules it was captured for; it never silences a repeated class,
//     because a pair of entries is exactly what has to get a fate;
//   · that fate is one of two, and both are WRITTEN: name the guard in the entry
//     (`mechanized: <the tool>`), or re-check the price ONCE FOR THE WHOLE CLASS and declare it —
//     `<!-- class-ok: <slug> — <why it is not cheaply possible> -->` in the journal. The declaration
//     is a decision with a reason in words, not a mute switch: an empty one is itself a finding, and
//     every declared class is printed on the summary line (that list, too, only shrinks). A second
//     `none-cheap:` inside one class is therefore not an answer — twice "not cheaply possible" is
//     exactly the moment to re-check the price and say the result out loud.
//
// Commands:

//        [--verbose]   # list every pre-class failure entry instead of the one fold line (origin issue #80)

//                             # read by every later bare `check`); a later write only shrinks it (origin issue #80)

// @guard experience-lesson-repeat
// THREAT:         the same failure class is written a second (and a sixth, and a seventeenth) time
//                 instead of being mechanized — the journal becomes the default sink and the
//                 deadline "two strikes" has no carrier (origin issue #69; recurrence of #14)
// PROVED-AGAINST: the selftest below — a journal with two failure entries of one class and no
//                 `mechanized:` reddens with `repeat` naming the class and BOTH ids, in both
//                 shipped languages; one mechanized entry of the pair silences it; a journal with
//                 no `class:` at all exits 3 (SKIPPED), never 0; sandbox suite s28 runs the
//                 deployed copy, and the red is proven on the 2.6 core via the KAIF_DIST seam
//                 (the module does not exist there) and on mutants of the repeat axis itself
// GAP:            a WRONG slug splits a real pair into two classes — a false green, invisible to
//                 this axis (the marking is a human judgement; the linter only counts); an entry
//                 whose marker is a bare success is out of scope by construction; `dangling` reads
//                 the value as text, so a guard named in prose ("the check axis of the core") is
//                 neither confirmed nor denied; the journal of a project that keeps its lessons
