// prompt-resume-word.mjs — the "leading word is an order" hook (KAIF 2.7, epic RS; optional
// refresh-hooks module, deployed to .kaif/hooks/). Claude Code event: UserPromptSubmit.
//
// What it does: mechanizes the canon rule "A leading skill word is an order" (AGENT_GUIDE.md →
// next to "The form of an obligation"). The owner opens a chat with the bare word `resume` (or
// its Russian shorthand, "rezyum…") and writes the task below it; a session that reads the word as
// a TOPIC starts the task and skips the entry ritual — it then works without the canon, the
// owner's queue, the creed and the prayer. This hook reads the FIRST WORD of the prompt and, when
// it is the resume word, injects an ORDER: run /resume in full BEFORE any work on the rest of the
// message. Any other message → no output at all: silence is the normal state.
//
// Predicate (anti-noise): the prompt's first word is `/resume`, `resume` or the Russian shorthand
// "rezyum…" (any case; leading whitespace tolerated). The word ANYWHERE ELSE in the message is prose — the kick's
// boundary ("a command word mid-sentence is not a command", /kaif-go) holds unchanged, and the hook
// never fires on it. No cooldown: every message that opens with the word is a separate order (the
// owner writes it once per chat by design). No `prompt` field in the event → silent: a predicate
// over text cannot be guessed without the text, and a guess would fire on every prompt.
//
// Field origin (the origin's owner, 2026-09-18, rendered from Russian): "when I start a chat and
// just write the word resume at the top and below it what we do, agents often do not run the
// resume skill — and that is exactly why I write it there. If I write it, I REQUIRE the agent to
// run that skill before starting the work."
//
// Contract (Claude Code — the sibling hooks' contract was live-fetched 2026-08-07; the
// UserPromptSubmit event carries the user's message text in `prompt`): stdin — JSON with
// `hook_event_name`, `cwd`, `prompt`; stdout on exit 0 — {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName":
// "UserPromptSubmit", "additionalContext": "…"}}. A hook must never break the session: any
// internal error → exit 0 silently.
// [TESTED: 2026-09-25 17:43 +03:00 - 2.8, epic OW, OW2: s14 +7 (an imperative before the word — the order; the Russian noun with a colon — silence;
//  a leading stop in three forms — the order to stop; a longer word starting with the same letters — silence), red on the 2.7 dist exactly
//  on the five new behaviours; mutants M8-M10 of tools/sandbox/probes/hooks-mutants.mjs red on their addressees; the WIRED command of the
//  origin's .claude/settings.json fed Claude Code shaped events with the owner's real prompts of session 74 — mid-turn messages silent,
//  "resume" and the field opening "execute resume" (Russian) the order, the heading silent, the bug-123 "STOP" and a bare stop the stop
//  order; a stop typed by the owner MID-TURN through the live harness is not observed yet; report testcases/reports/2026-09-25_ow2-owner-word-mid-turn.md]
// [TESTED: 2026-09-18 08:12 +03:00 - FUNCTIONAL run on the owner's real path: the owner opened a new
//  chat of the origin with "resume" + newline + "continue" (in Russian), this hook wired in
//  .claude/settings.json; the injected order stood in the session context, was quoted in the chat
//  verbatim BEFORE the refresh marker was stamped, and /resume ran in full; report -
//  testcases/reports/2026-09-18_hook-resume-word.md, run 17, verdict pass. Hygiene beside it: polygon s14
//  6/6 ("resume" + newline + task, the Cyrillic shorthand with a period, "/resume" -> the order; no word,
//  the word mid-sentence, no `prompt` field -> silence), the 2.6 core (KAIF_DIST) 8 asserts red, a mutant
//  bundle with the predicate broken exactly the 3 order asserts red - hygiene alone never flipped this
//  marker (TESTING_FRAMEWORK.md, hygiene is not a test)]
//
// PORTABILITY — `--emit <shape>`: `claude` only. OpenAI Codex reads the same output fields on
// UserPromptSubmit, but whether ITS event carries the prompt text was not read in its live
// documentation — so no Codex sample wires this hook (README table: "prompt field not verified").
// A wrong guess would fail invisibly; an explicit gap stays visible.
