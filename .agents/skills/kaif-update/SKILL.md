# /kaif-update — respectful migration update from origin

A newer KAIF version exists upstream (see `/kaif-version`). Since KAIF 1.5 the heavy lifting is
**mechanical**: the machinery (`.kaif/kaif-core.mjs`) knows what was deployed and which files were never
touched since (content snapshots in `.kaif/deploy-manifest.json`), so it replaces the untouched framework
files itself, adds the new ones, never enters owner content (`GOAL.md`, `STATUS.md`, the knowledge
directories, your project files), and hands you a short `KAIF_UPDATE_TASK.md` covering ONLY the genuinely
diverged places. Your cognitive work is that task, not the migration.

> ⚠️ This changes the framework wrapper. Confirm with the human before applying. Commit first so the
> update is a clean, revertable diff.

## Procedure

1. **Pre-flight.** Working tree clean (commit/stash first). Read `.kaif/kaif.json`: if `tracking` is
   `fork`, confirm the human really wants to pull from the official origin.

2. **Route by what the project has:**
   - **`.kaif/kaif-core.mjs` exists (KAIF ≥ 1.5):** run `node .kaif/kaif-core.mjs update`
     (or `npm run kaif:update`). It fetches the latest machinery from origin (sha256-verified),
     replaces every framework file that is byte-identical to its install snapshot, adds new files,
     keeps diverged ones untouched, swaps the machinery itself, stamps `.kaif/kaif.json`, and writes
     `KAIF_UPDATE_TASK.md`.
   - **No machinery (KAIF ≤ 1.4, or an anonymous install):** put the fresh **thin `KAIF.md`** from the
     origin release in the project root and follow its bootstrap (three `KAIF-BOOT:` steps). The
     installer detects the existing older `.kaif/kaif.json` and runs as an update: existing files are
     KEPT, new entities added, owner-level fields of the marker preserved, and `KAIF_UPDATE_TASK.md`
     replaces the usual adaptation task.

3. **Work `KAIF_UPDATE_TASK.md`** — the only cognitive part: merge the template news into the files the
   machinery could not touch (they carry your local edits), review what's new, run
   `node .kaif/kaif-core.mjs check`, and finish with a `/fable-judge` pass over the update. Tick each
   item AND append its `KAIF-UPDATE: <id> done` checkpoint.

4. **Verify & self-clean:** `node .kaif/kaif-core.mjs update-verify` — it greps the checkpoints and
   removes the transient installer files.

5. **Report & commit.** Summarize: replaced/added/kept counts, what you merged by hand, anything left
   for the human. Commit `chore: update KAIF to X.Y`.

## Notes
- The guiding word is **respectful**: the project must stay whole and working at every step; owner
  content is never in the update's scope at all.
- If the migration is large or risky, do it behind a clean commit so it's easy to revert.
- A heavily diverged project may be better served by a fork (`/kaif-fork`) than by tracking origin.
