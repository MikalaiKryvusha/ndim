description: Revise the backlog — walk bugs/ and plans/ (including ideas/), find everything WITHOUT a DONE tag in the filename as open tasks and collect a current list, and for the ones that are actually finished, tag the file DONE in its name (git mv) and append a status section inside the document. Called by the human ("check the backlog", "revise the backlog", "mark done things DONE", "what's left", "проверь беклог", "пометь сделанное DONE") AND by the agent periodically in autonomous loops and at refresh-context, so the backlog doesn't rot and closed work is tagged. Trigger aliases (ru): «проверь беклог», «ревизуй беклог», «что осталось», «пометь сделанное DONE»

# /check-backlog — backlog revision (bugs/ and plans/) and DONE tagging

Over time, `bugs/` and `plans/` accumulate files that are DONE but not tagged `DONE` — so the file
listing no longer tells you what's left. This skill tidies up: it collects the current open list AND
tags the genuinely-closed files DONE.

Relies on the `DONE`-tag-in-filename convention (see `AGENT_GUIDE.md` → "Backlog & the DONE tag").

## What to do

1. **Collect all backlog files:**
   - `ls bugs/` — all bug docs.
   - `ls plans/` and `ls ideas/` — ideas/features and worklogs/plans.
   - ⚠️ `plans/` contains REFERENCE docs (not tasks): `MASTER_PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_STRUCTURE_EXTERNAL_MAP.md`, `GOAL.md`,
     `context.md`, etc. — do NOT tag these DONE; they're living references, not closable tasks. Only tag
     concrete bugs/ideas/features/tasks.

2. **Split into two lists by filename:**
   - **Open (no `DONE` in name)** — candidates for the "to implement" backlog. Note them.
   - **Tagged `DONE`** — already closed, skip.

3. **For EACH open file — determine the real status** (don't guess!):
   - Read the document: is there a status of ✅/CLOSED/IMPLEMENTED/FIXED/PROVEN inside?
   - Cross-check `STATUS.md` and, if needed, the code/`git log` — is it actually done?
   - **If actually DONE and confirmed** → do the DONE tagging (step 4).
   - **If NOT done / partial / research-only (🔧/🟡/🔬)** → leave open, add to the current backlog (with
     a short "what's left").
   - **If unclear** → do NOT tag; leave open and mark "needs verification".

4. **DONE tagging (only for confirmed-closed):**
   - Rename, inserting `DONE` after the number, preserving history:
     `git mv bugs/13_detach_crash.md bugs/13_DONE_detach_crash.md` (don't change the number; format
     `<NN>_DONE_<name>.md`).
   - **Append a status section inside the document**, e.g.:
     ```
     ## ✅ STATUS: DONE (<date>)
     What was done: <short summary of the fix/implementation>.
     How verified: <build/harness/measurement/commit hash/loop iteration>.
     ```
   - Commit (in a loop, by the usual commit discipline; otherwise batch at the end of the revision).

5. **Produce the summary:**
   - A short list of OPEN tasks (the backlog) with priority: finish started > bugs > new ideas.
   - The list of files tagged `DONE` in this revision.
   - Anything left as "needs verification" (unclear status).

## Notes
- Careful revision: tag DONE only what is REALLY closed and verified — better to leave open than to
  wrongly close.
- Reference docs in `plans/` are never DONE-tagged.
- In autoloops and at `/refresh-context`, call this once every few iterations, not every iteration.
- If human-level questions surface — file in `interviews/` + mark `STATUS.md`, don't decide blindly.
