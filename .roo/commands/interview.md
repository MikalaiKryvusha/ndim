description: Interview the human about open questions the agent must NOT decide alone — UI/UX decisions, serious technical forks, choices that define the brand or architecture. A rare event: by default the agent works autonomously. Use when the agent hits such a decision, OR when the human says "interview me", "ask me", "let's do an interview", "interview", "проведи интервью", "спроси меня", "уточни у меня". Trigger aliases (ru): «возьми интервью», «задай вопросы по развилке», «интервью»

# /interview — interview the owner

This skill captures decisions that **must not be made autonomously** into an md document in
`interviews/` and pauses the work until the human answers.

All interviews live in `interviews/interview_NNN_<topic>.md`.

## When to call (this is a RARE event)

By default the agent works **autonomously** and makes technical decisions with sensible defaults.
Interviews are the exception. Call one ONLY when the question is genuinely the owner's:

- **A UI/UX decision** — how something looks, behaves, feels for the end user. Never make a UI/UX choice
  without confirmation.
- **A serious technical fork** — choosing a library/protocol/architectural approach with long-lived,
  hard-to-reverse consequences.
- **Brand / vision / product priorities** — naming, icon, target platforms, what's in a phase vs. not.

Do NOT call an interview for: small implementation details, variable names, ordinary bug fixes,
refactors, choices between equivalent technical options — decide those yourself and report in the chat.

If unsure "is this the owner's level or mine?", ask: *is it cheap to reverse?* If yes — decide yourself.
If it shapes brand/architecture/UX for the long term — interview.

## Procedure

### Step 1. Preparation (before writing questions)
- Read the context in code/docs — don't ask what you can find out yourself.
- Verify the technical facts that determine which options are even possible (e.g. "can this dialog be
  removed?", "does the library have the needed API?"). A question without verified groundwork is a bad question.
- Look at past interviews (`ls interviews/`) so you don't duplicate accepted decisions and keep one style.

### Step 2. Create the interview document
- Name: `interviews/interview_NNN_<short_topic>.md`, where `NNN` is the next free number
  (`ls interviews/` → max+1, format `004`, `005`, …).
- Template:
  ```markdown
  # Interview #NNN — <Topic>

  > Topic: <one sentence on what this interview is about>
  > Source of the idea: <file/chat, date>
  > Status: **🟡 awaiting the owner's answers**

  ## Context / what I already found in the code
  <briefly: current state + verified technical facts that constrain the options>

  ## QUESTIONS

  ### Q1. <question>
  - **A) (recommended)** <the option distilled through PHILOSOPHY.md — simplest/most effective — + why>
  - **B)** <option>
  - **C)** <option>
  - **D) your own answer** — <the owner writes their own here>

  **Answer:**

  ### Q2. ...

  ## Proposed implementation plan (after answers)
  <the steps you'll take once the questions are closed>
  ```

### Step 3. Rules for good questions
- **Closed** options **A/B/C/D** — not an open "what's best?".
- **Option A is always the recommendation**, marked `(recommended)`, and is **distilled through
  `PHILOSOPHY.md`** — run the choice through the principle set (simplicity/KISS + Occam first, then Pareto,
  best-practices, second-order thinking, …). In the vast majority of cases A is the simplest, clearest, most
  useful, effective, and fastest way to what the owner wants. Put it first.
- **Option D is always "your own answer"** — a slot for the owner to write their own choice if none of
  A/B/C fits.
- **B and C** are the serious alternatives, each with a short "why" / trade-off.
- Group: usually 1–5 questions per interview; when the topic genuinely needs it — **up to 10**. Don't
  pad, but don't starve the interview either: a cramped interview that misses what the agent actually
  needed to clarify is worse than a few extra questions.
- Don't ask what's already decided in `plans/`/`MASTER_PLAN.md` or past interviews.

### Step 4. Ask the owner — via the document
The default, autonomy-friendly method: the owner answers **right in the md document** (fills the
"**Answer:**" fields). This keeps the work async — the agent isn't blocked on a synchronous chat.

Sequence:
- Compose `interviews/interview_NNN_<topic>.md` with questions and "**Answer:**" fields.
- Write ONE paragraph in the chat: what you found, the forks, and a link to the document.
- **Pause** the work (so the owner is signaled to come and fill in the answers). Don't guess for them and
  don't proceed blindly on UI/UX/brand/architecture questions.

### Step 5. After the answers
- Write the decisions into the document: change status to `✅ ANSWERS RECEIVED <date>` and add a
  "Decisions" table.
- If the decisions affect the plan/architecture — update `STATUS.md` and the relevant files in `plans/`.
- Proceed to implement per the approved plan (or, if the owner asks to pause — call `/pause`).

## Notes
- Style and language — match the owner's.
- Past interviews are the reference for tone and structure.
- The skill's goal — minimize bothering the owner, but do NOT make their fateful decisions for them.
