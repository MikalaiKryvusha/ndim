description: Investigate a bug WITHOUT coding/fixing/builds — web-search the problem and collect a raw knowledge base, read and analyze the code to find the cause, reflect and write hypotheses into the bug document. Use when a bug resists direct attempts (≥3 failed blind fix iterations), OR when the human says "research the bug", "look this up", "figure out the cause", "stop poking blindly", "research", "investigate", "исследуй баг", "разберись в причине". Trigger aliases (ru): «исследуй баг», «разберись в причине», «хватит тыкать вслепую», «погугли проблему»

# /bug-research — deep bug investigation without coding

Used when a bug **won't yield to direct attempts** (rule: after **3 failed iterations** of
fix→build→test we stop going blind — see `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`). Random poking wastes time and
builds; stop and UNDERSTAND the cause.

> ⛔ In this skill we do NOT write code, do NOT fix, do NOT build, do NOT run the software. Only reading,
> searching, analysis, reflection, and writing into the bug's md document. Pure cognitive work.

## Step 0. Anchor on the bug

- Open the bug doc in `bugs/NN_*.md` (if none — create one per `BUG_FIXING_FRAMEWORK.md`).
- Briefly write out: the symptom, what's been tried (attempt log), under what conditions it reproduces.
- Tell the human in one line that you're switching to research mode (we stop poking blindly).

## Step 1. Web search — collect a RAW knowledge base

Make several targeted queries (`WebSearch`), then pull the most relevant pages (`WebFetch`). Look in:
library GitHub issues/discussions/wiki, Stack Overflow, Reddit, official docs.

- Phrase queries by exact APIs/classes/symptoms (method names, error texts, versions).
- **Record the raw data VERBATIM** in the bug doc under "Knowledge base — raw search data": quotes from
  maintainers, method signatures, explanations, source links. This is knowledge for future sessions —
  don't paraphrase loosely; preserve facts and links.
- Separately note: **is what we're doing even possible** (sometimes it's a platform/library limitation).

## Step 2. Code analysis — find where the cause is (no edits)

Read and trace the chain related to the bug (data/calls/state). Don't edit — dissect.

- Build the chain (data flow / call flow) from the source of the problem to the symptom; write it down.
- Find suspicious spots: who passes what, where a value is lost/distorted, what assumptions are made.
- Map our attempts against what you learned ("attempt → what it does per the docs → why it didn't help").

> 🧠 Keep `PHILOSOPHY.md` in mind: a stall usually means the SOLUTION is too complex from misunderstanding
> the task, not that the task is hard. Look for the SIMPLE supported path (KISS + Occam). If the
> hypothesis/plan turns bulky — you probably still don't understand the task; restate it in plain words.

## Step 3. Reflection and hypotheses

In the bug doc, state:
- **A root-cause hypothesis** (one or two, justified by steps 1–2).
- **Next steps for a focused coding session** — concrete, testable (which files, which experiment, how to
  verify the result reliably — not "by eye").
- **Open questions for the human**, if the choice of approach is theirs.

## Step 4. Summary in the chat

Briefly: what you found (key facts), the working cause hypothesis, and the proposed plan for the next
coding pass. Do NOT start fixing within this skill — it ends with a ready knowledge base.

## Notes
- A reliable verification method matters more than speed: if a visual check is unreliable, invent an
  objective one (known-shape controls, measurements, size logs) and write it into the doc.
- The skill's goal: turn "it won't work, I'm poking blindly" into "I understand the cause, I have a plan".
